# Introduction
Roads play a major role in the lives of people living in various states, cities, towns and villages. From their daily travel to work, to schools, to business meetings, to the transport of goods and enablement of services, roads play major role in facilitating rural and urban life. In this modern era, where roads have been laid down in the most remote locations, they prove to be one of the most useful mediums for transportation and travel. The manipulation of shortest paths between various locations sometimes proves to be tricky when dealing with complex road networks. Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to overcome the problem of finding shortest path. The main objective of this algorithm is to find shortest path between two points or nodes in any network with minimum cost implementation. Dijkstra algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of Floyd Warshall Algorithm as well as Bellman Ford Algorithm but it can be improvised if we implement it parallelly. Hence, in this project we will try to improvise the algorithm using parallel computing.
